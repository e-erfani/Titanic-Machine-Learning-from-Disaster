# Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster

We would like to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using Machine Learning. The survival seemed to be dependent on features such as class, Sex, Age, Fare, and so on. This is a project I completed on the Kaggle website. 

The Junyper Notebook includes cleaning data, exploratory data analysis, employing multiple machine learning algorithms, and various validations. Every step is explained clearly to make it easy to understand.
